Task 1:
List of Objects
Create a new component called StudentList.jsx.
Define an array of student objects:
const students = [
  { id: 1, name: "John", grade: "A" },
  { id: 2, name: "Emma", grade: "B" },
  { id: 3, name: "Liam", grade: "A" },
  { id: 4, name: "Olivia", grade: "C" },
];
Use map() to render a table with columns: ID, Name, and Grade.
Use the id field as the key prop for each row.

Task 2:
Create a new React component called FruitsList.jsx.
Inside the component, define an array of fruits:
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango", "Grapes"];
Use the map() method to display each fruit inside an unordered list (<ul>).
Assign a unique key prop to each <li> element using the index or fruit name.
Render the component in your App.js.

Task 3:
Modify the previously created static website cards with list rendering concepts
